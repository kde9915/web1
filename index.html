<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the workshop is to bring together providers of Machine Learning tools and frameworks with Web platform practitioners to enrich the Open Web Platform with better foundations for machine learning.

The secondary goals of the workshop are as follows:

Understand how machine learning fits into the Web technology stack,
Understand how browser-based machine learning fits into the machine learning ecosystem,
Explore the impact of machine learning technologies on Web browsers and Web applications,
Evaluate the opportunities for standardization around machine learning APIs and formats.
Expected topics of discussion include:

Dedicated machine learning APIs for browsers as explored by the Machine Learning for the Web Community Group
Integration of browser-provided data sources in machine learning workflows
Layering and interoperability of machine learning APIs with other computing APIs (e.g. WebGPU, WebAssembly)
Domain-specific machine learning APIs
Interchange format for machine learning models on the Web
Client- and cloud-based machine learning interactions
On-device machine learning training in browsers
Risks and benefits of browser-based machine learning on privacy, security, accessibility
Using machine learning primitives to help improve accessibility of Web pages and applications
Machine learning frameworks for the Web
Machine learning hardware accelerators
Attendance is free for all invited participants and is open to the public, whether or not W3C members. For more information on the workshop, please see the workshop details and submission instructions.

Registration is available online due by 21 February 2020.
